# mi:little coder

A very simple text-based programming language for the BBC micro:bit, written in Python.

To use it you need:
- A BBC micro:bit (it's currently still small enough to run on a V1)
- A micro USB cable
- A computer with either serial terminal software or access via Chrome or Edge web browsers to either the online micro:bit Python editor https://python.microbit.org/v/2 or something like https://googlechromelabs.github.io/serial-terminal/
